<b>FEEL FREE TO EDIT AND WRITE IN MORE IDEAS</b>

As we are not required to provide a whole working project, we will work on a demo and generalize it as much as possible. Our aim is to show the important functions.
  1.	Upload a file. Supporting formats include – CSV, XML, JSON
  2.	Edit a file. I.e – Add data, remove data, modify data
  3.	Delete a file
Instead of creating a software application, we will make a small web application.
Tools we will use – 
  1.	Java for backend
  2.	HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript for frontend
  3.	MySQL for data management and security
Honestly, I myself never used java as a backend technology, so I need a learn a lot of things myself.

The first thing we need to learn is CRUD operations with Java. CRUD is a popular term which stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 
So, this is how I would move forward with this application – 
  1.	Learn how to read a file of these formats – CSV, XML, JSON using Java
  2.	Learn to write on those formats
  3.	Learn to modify the content on those files
  4.	Learn to create a server using Java. Look into JAX-RS. (Just Google JAX-RS)
  5.	Learn to display the contents from those formats on our server/html page
  6.	Learn to create a login page using HTML and CSS which will be connected to our Java Backend
  7.	Learn to use MySQL to store usernames and passwords
  8.	Learn to match the username and password provided by a user on our HTML page with our MySQL database
After we learn those 8 things, we can easily connect everything together and hopefully come up with a very impressive mini project.
In short, skipping the whole technical part, this is what our project will do – 
We will load our html page on the browser, we will have an option – GUEST or ADMINISTRATOR,
If you are a guest, you will be redirected to the page where you can only download data files. But if you are an admin, you will be directed to the login page, 
	where you will login and then we will show the options for creating/adding a new data file, editing an existing a data file and even deleting a data file.

How will creating a data file work? Just an idea – things may change as we code.
- We will simply have an upload button and upload a file. The files we upload will be stored in our MySQL database and from there, it will be displayed to our HTML page. 
	We may need to look into “How to display contents from a CSV file on HTML page?” IF by any chance that doesn’t work out. 
	What we will do is, use Java to read the contents from the CSV file and pass it as “string” to our HTML file and display it like that.

How will we modify an existing database?
- This is a tricky one. So, we will select the file that we want to edit on our HTML page. Say we have a file with this following table - 

ID	NAME	AGE	ADDRESS
89	Dawgy Dawg	24	Jojo street
			

Now, to edit the contents of these, using Java we will first read the headers. In this case- ID, NAME, AGE, ADDRESS. We will display on the HTML page the headers 
and ask the user to fill it up.

Like for example- After the user hits “edit”, the user will be asked -
What is the ID?
<i>- User types an ID</i>
What is the NAME?
<i>- User types NAME</i>
What is the AGE?
<i>-User types AGE</i>
What is the ADDRESS?
<i>- User types address</i>
The information is sent to our Java backend, and I’m pretty sure, it’s easy to append data to files using Java. We appended a lot of stuff in C, if you recall.
And boom. The file gets updated with the new content. 

I think that’s a lot for now. Let’s skip the delete option cause we may not be able to finish it on time.
